QUEUE : 

A Queue is a fundamental Data Structure (DS) in computer science, following the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means the element that was added earliest is the first one to be removed, much like people waiting in a line.

Key Characteristics and Principle
FIFO (First-In, First-Out): The element added first is always the one removed first.

Linear Structure: Elements are arranged sequentially.

Two Ends: Operations occur at two distinct ends:

Rear (or Tail): Where elements are inserted (enqueued).

Front (or Head): Where elements are deleted (dequeued).

Basic Operations
There are typically four main operations associated with a Queue:

Enqueue (or Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.

Dequeue (or Delete): Removes an element from the front of the queue.

Peek (or Front/Top): Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

isEmpty: Checks if the queue contains any elements.

isFull: Checks if the queue is full or not
