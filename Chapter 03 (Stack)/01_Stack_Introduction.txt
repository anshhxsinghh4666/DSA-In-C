STACK : Linear Data Structure 

Principle Stack Follow : 
-> Insertion and Deletion is only possible from one end.
-> Last In - First Out  OR  First In - Last Out         
        +-----+
        | 50  |   <-- Top  (Last In - First Out)
        +-----+
        | 40  |
        +-----+
        | 30  |
        +-----+
        | 20  |
        +-----+
        | 10  |   <-- Bottom  (First In - Last Out)
        +-----+


Operations on Stack : All Operations can be performed from the top of stack only

-> Inserting Data : Push(x) 
        ~ x->Data to Push
        ~ Can Only Push element of same data type

-> Deleting Data : Pop()
        ~ Pops the top most element 
        ~ No need to pass any argument
        ~ Returns top most element from the stack and removes it from the stack.

-> Peek / Top : peek() / top()
        ~ Returns top most element from the stack WITHOUT removing it.

-> Empty : isempty()
        ~ Return true if the stack is empty , otherwise returns false.

-> Full : isfull()
        ~ Return false if the stack is empty , otherwise returns true.


There are two ways to implement stack : 
-> Static Memory Allocation : Using Arrays
-> Dynamic Memory Allocation : Using Linked List

Zero based Indexing : 
Index  Top
 4    +-----+
      | 50  |   <-- Top = 4
      +-----+
 3    | 40  |
      +-----+
 2    | 30  |
      +-----+
 1    | 20  |
      +-----+
 0    | 10  |   <-- Bottom = 0
      +-----+

In starting Hypothetically we assume top = -1

UNDERFLOW CONDITION : When we apply pop() operation on empty Stack it will be an UNDERFLOW CONDITION

When we apply push operation in stack firstly increment top (top++) before every push, even pushing in empty stack as empty stack top = -1.
When we apply pop operation in stack , after poping out decreament value of top (top--)

OVERFLOW CONDITION : When we push data in a full stack. We can't push data in a full stack.

APPLICATIONS OF STACK : 
-> Reverse a string 
-> Undo Operation
-> Recusrion or Function Call
-> Infix to PostFix/Prefix Conversion 
-> Evolution of Post Fix Expression
-> Tower of Hanoi
